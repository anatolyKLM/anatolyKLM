- 👋 Hi, I’m @anatolyKLM
- 👀 I’m interested in the fundamentals of ICT & Operations Research. A new path of research lies through Abstract Algebra & Systems Architecture. I'm sincerely surprised how many topics in these areas were left without scientific consideration.
- 🌱 I'm currently a remote student studying Сategory Theory, Architectural frameworks, and generic research Methodologies. I collect initial data for building a Theory of Personal Systems and modeling the general Education System.
- 💞️ I want to collaborate on these interesting projects for me from the perspective of applied mathematics.
